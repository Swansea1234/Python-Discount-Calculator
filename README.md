# Python-Discount-Calculator
A simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount, with a specific condition that the discount must be 20% or higher.

Overview
This project is a small, two-file Python application that demonstrates basic function creation and module imports. It's a great example for beginners to understand how to organize code into separate, logical files for better readability and reusability.

discounts.py: Contains the core logic for the discount calculation.

main.py: Handles user input, calls the calculation function, and prints the result.

How to Use
Save the files: Make sure both discounts.py and main.py are saved in the same directory (folder).

Run the program: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the following command:
python Main.py
Follow the prompts: The program will ask you to enter the original price and the discount percentage.

See the result: The program will display the final price after the discount, or the original price if the discount was too low.
